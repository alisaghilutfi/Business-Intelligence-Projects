### Key Calculated Measures
```dax
Customer LTV (avg) = SUM(Sales[Sales]) / [Number of Customers]

Profit % = SUM(Sales[Profit (Baseline)]) / SUM(Sales[Sales])

Profit (Baseline) = Sales[Sales] - Sales[COGS] - [Shipping (Baseline)]

Shipping (Baseline) = SUMX(Sales,
                           IF(Sales[Quantity]=1,
                              Sales[Shipping Cost],
                              Sales[Shipping Cost]+(((Sales[Quantity])-1)*(Sales[Shipping Cost]*0.7))))

Blended Shipping Cost Factor = IF('What-if quantity'[What-if quantity Value]<=1, 1,
                                  IF('What-if quantity'[What-if quantity Value]<=2, 0.8,
                                     IF('What-if quantity'[What-if quantity Value]<=4, 0.6,
                                        IF('What-if quantity'[What-if quantity Value]<=7, 0.5,
                                           IF('What-if quantity'[What-if quantity Value]<=9,0.4,0.3)))))

Shipping (What-if) = SUMX(Sales,
                          IF(Sales[Quantity]=1,
                             Sales[Shipping Cost],
                             Sales[Shipping Cost]+(((Sales[Quantity])-1)*(Sales[Shipping Cost]*[Blended Shipping Cost Factor]))))

Shipping (Difference) = [Shipping (Baseline)] - [Shipping (What-if)]
```
